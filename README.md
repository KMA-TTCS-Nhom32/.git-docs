## Project Overview

Brief description of the project, its goals, and what the repository contains.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (or any other project-specific software)
- [GitHub CLI (optional)](https://cli.github.com/)

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

If you don't have write access to the repository, fork it to your GitHub account.

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the upper right-hand corner.
3. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd REPO-NAME
   ```

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

To keep your local fork updated with the main repository, you need to add an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/REPO-NAME.git
```

Verify the remote URLs:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see both `origin` and `upstream` listed.

## Setting Up the Repository

### Install Project Dependencies

After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies (if applicable, for example, if this is a Node.js project):

```bash
npm install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

If your project requires environment variables, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the necessary values in `.env`.

## Git Workflow

### Step 1: Create a New Branch

Always work on a new branch. To create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for the branch.

### Step 2: Make Changes

Now, make your changes in the appropriate files. Follow the project's coding standards and commit often.

### Step 3: Stage and Commit Changes

After making changes, stage the files and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add meaningful commit message"
```

### Step 4: Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Collaborating with the Team

### Syncing with Upstream

Before starting a new feature or making changes, always ensure your local branch is up-to-date with the upstream repository.

1. Fetch the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. Merge changes into your branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. If you were on a feature branch, rebase it with the updated `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your work for review, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork if you havenâ€™t already:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.
3. Click the **Compare & pull request** button.
4. Fill in the necessary details, explaining what your feature/fix does.
5. Submit the pull request to the **main** branch of the upstream repository.

### Step 2: Wait for Code Review

Your code will be reviewed by one or more maintainers. If changes are requested, make the changes locally, commit, and push them to your fork.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

This will automatically update the pull request.

## Best Practices

- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful, concise commit messages.
- **Branch Names**: Use descriptive names like `feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/fix-bug-name`.
- **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards and run tests before submitting your changes.
- **Communication**: Use pull request descriptions to explain the purpose of your changes and any important details.
